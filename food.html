                    <h2># Bubble Tea</h2>
                    <p>Bubble Tea originated in Taiwan in the early 1980's at a small tea stand. Elementary school children would look forward to buying a cup of refreshing tea after a long, hard day of work and play. Tea stands were set up in front of the schools and would compete for business with the best selling tea.</p>
                    <p>One concession owner became popular with her tea when she started adding different fruit flavoring to her tea. Because of the sweet and cool taste, children loved the taste. Soon, other concessions heard about the "unique" and popular tea, so they started to add flavoring to their teas. When adding flavor, the tea and flavoring needed to be shaken well for a good all around taste. This formed bubbles in the drink, which came to be known as "Bubble Tea."</p>
                    <p>In 1983 Liu Han-Chieh introduced Taiwan to tapioca pearls. The new fad was to add tapioca pearls into a favorite drink. Most of the time tapioca pearls were served in cold infused tea. After the tea and flavor were shaken well, it topped tapioca pearls that were sitting on the bottom of a clear cup. The tapioca pearls also looked like bubbles, thus also became to known as "Bubble Tea." Bubbles floated on the top your drink and bottom of your drink.

                    <h2># Dan Bing</h2>
                    <p>Dan Bing is one of the most popular breakfast items in Taiwan.  It's a thin crepe-like savory pancake with an egg cooked into it and rolled together with the filling of your choice.  This may sound simple, but it's very addictive.</p>
                    <p>Many of my friends who've visited Taiwan told me that they miss having Dan Bing for breakfast.  In fact, most Taiwanese people buy their breakfast from stores or street vendors instead of making it at home, and the Dan Bing is one item that's almost always available.

                    <h2># Stinky Tofu</h2>
                    <p>You'll usually smell it before you see it - the bane of most foreigners in Taiwan - many don't attempt to get past the nauseating waft of odor that comes from this fermented tofu dish. The taste is quite different however, with a kind of cheesy, fermented taste to it that goes perfectly with the slightly spicy sauce that's often served on top.</p>
                    <p>The longer it's been fermented for generally the more flavor and tastier it gets, albeit along with a stronger smell. Pinch your nose if you have to and take a bite, cause this delicious snack is one of the best on the island.

                    <h2># Wheel Pies</h2>
                    <p>As Eater explains, the traditional food is made to order by a woman behind a counter that "carefully cooks a thin cake-like batter in a mold that is then filled with any number of ingredients of choice." These include Oreos, taro, red bean, matcha or more savory options the likes of tuna with black pepper and corn with cheese. After working on the fillings, the staff places yet another layer of wheel pie on top of the concoction to create a unique sandwich.</p>
                    <p>The best part of the affair? Its price tag: around $3 a pop. You're clearly going to want to try a vast array of them.
